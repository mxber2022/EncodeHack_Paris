Welcome to my DApp (Decentralized Application)! This project is a simple DApp that allows users to send Ether and mint NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) using Biconomy's one-click batch and gasless transaction feature. Additionally, I have integrated Circle cross-chain bridge to enable token bridging from one chain to another using Biconomy's batch transaction. With just one click, users can bridge USDC tokens from one chain to another.
